### Customization

Feel free to customize the gradient colors and blur intensity in the main component file. The code is structured to allow easy modifications, enabling you to tailor the effect to fit your app's theme.

### Example

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to implement the animated gradient blur in your app:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { LinearGradient } from 'expo-linear-gradient';
import { BlurView } from 'expo-blur';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <LinearGradient
        colors={['#ff7e5f', '#feb47b']}
        style={styles.gradient}
      >
        <BlurView intensity={50} style={styles.absolute}>
          <Text style={styles.text}>Welcome to Expo Blur Gradient!</Text>
        </BlurView>
      </LinearGradient>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
  gradient: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  absolute: {
    position: 'absolute',
    top: 0,
    left: 0,
    right: 0,
    bottom: 0,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    color: '#fff',
    fontSize: 24,
  },
});

export default App;
```
